# StockX 360 Product GIF Creator
Creates a GIF out of StockX 360 Images in seconds!


Installation and Set Up
------------
Click Code > Download ZIP > Extract all files to desktop

- Create a folder titled gifs in the same directory as the app. Check the image below to see how it should look!
- If you would like to apply an overlay to the gif, add a png file titled 'overlay' (if it is not present, the script will not apply an overlay)
- If you do not code and you don't know how to set up and run a py file, dm me on discord for a .exe! File is too big to upload to GitHub.
